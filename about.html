                <p><h2>About this edition</h2><p>
                <p>A key music theory text within the fourteenth-century <i>Ars nova</i> tradition that has
                    received little attention is the so-called <i>Omni desideranti</i> treatise. The
                    treatise is found in three
                manuscript sources of Italian provenance dating from the fourteenth and
                fifteenth-centuries: in a manuscript copied by G. Frater de Anglia in Pavia in 1391, and now preserved in the
                Newberry Library in Chicago (Ms. 54.1, ff. 52v-56v, hereafter <i>Cn</i>); in a manuscript of Italian and Catalan origin
                dating from the early fifteenth century, Seville, Biblioteca Capitular y
                Colombina, Ms. 5-2-25, ff. 63r-64v (hereafter <i>Sc</i>);
                and a late fifteenth-century paper manuscript of Italian origin, Siena, Biblioteca
                comunale, Ms. L.V.30, ff. 129r-129v (hereafter <i>Su</i>).</p>

                <p>The text as preserved in <i>Cn</i> has no modern edition: it was edited in the nineteenth century by Coussemaker, apparently from a copy of this
                    manuscript transcribed by Coussemaker's friend Ferdinandus Wolf.  The text from <i>Sc</i>
                    was transcribed by Higini Angl&#232;s in an article from 1929
                (other than his expansion of scribal abbreviations, there are no editorial interventions in this transcription, with the exception of a few exclamation marks).
                    <i>Su</i> was edited by Gilbert Reaney and included as one representative of the Vitrian
                    tradition presented in volume 8 of <i>Corpus scriptorum musicae</i> (1964; there was no mention by Reaney in
                the introduction to the text of the parallel versions found in <i>Cn</i> and <i>Sc</i>).</p>

                <p>This online edition of the <i>Omni desideranti</i> treatise is intended as a
                proof-of-concept model for a digital editing approach to medieval music theory. It
                follows TEI encoding standards (the most up-to-date guidelines may be found at
                    <a
                        href="http://www.tei-c.org/Guidelines/P5/">http://www.tei-c.org/Guidelines/P5/</a>).
                    Using the XML files based on the TEI schema, a traditional critical edition is
                    offered, where variant readings are
                    displayed in the footnotes. Diplomatic transcriptions of the text as found
                    in the three different sources are presented in
                parallel with high-quality images of the manuscript sources. The free software tool
                Zoomify<sup>TM</sup> allows the user to zoom in on these images,
                while also protecting the image files from illegal downloads. Using the same data files, PDF and ePub versions of the texts can be generated:
                these are provided as downloads on the website. An English translation is provided,
                and a collation of the the three witnesses generated by the Juxta<sup>TM</sup> web service. The advantages of this edition include the higher level of
                transparency into any editorial interventions as the evidence of the transcriptions and the original source documents are displayed side-by-side.
                In addition, it allows for a greater degree of interactivity on the part of the user as one can examine paragraphs or sections of text more closely.
                This edition
                is intended to spark comment and debate about the future and potential of these
                types of approaches for musicology, and for any feedback to assist other individuals
                and institutions working on larger, more robust and scalable applications.</p>

                <p> I presented a paper on this edition at the annual meeting of the American Musicological
                Society in New Orleans (Oct 31-Nov 4, 2012) and the online edition and web-based
                approach is the subject of my forthcoming article:
